Dedicated module repo: https://github.com/deity-io/falcon-magento2-module.

This repository is for module development.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have your access keys ready for  `repo.magento.com` and `github`.

### Prerequisites

Deity Magento module is compatible with magento version 2.2. CE and EE versions. 
Full scale support of versions 2.0.* and 2.1.* is not our priority.
However if you encounter an issue running with magento version lower than 2.2 feel free
to open an issue or reach out to our support channel.
```
magento >= 2.2
```

### Installing

Installing deity magento module is similar to installing any module for Magento 2 platform 

```
git clone git@github.com:deity-io/falcon-magento2-development.git magento_folder
composer install
```
When the magento is setup, create one extra magento admin user for Deity Falcon to connect

```
bin/magento  admin:user:create  --admin-user='your-admin-username' --admin-password='your-admin-password' --admin-email='admin@deity.test' --admin-firstname='node' --admin-lastname='Deity'
```
